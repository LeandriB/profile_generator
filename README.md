# Team Profile Generator

    The goal for this project was to generate a team member profile that includes all the necessary components to identify and contact a specific member of the team.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  ````
    GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
    WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
    THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
    WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
    THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
    WHEN I click on the GitHub username
    THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
    WHEN I start the application
    THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
    WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
    THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
    WHEN I select the engineer option
    THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
    WHEN I select the intern option
    THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
    WHEN I decide to finish building my team
    THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
